## Welcome to my GitHub profile 👨‍💻

### 👋 About Me

🎓 I'm a final-year **Engineering and Data Analysis** student at **Rzeszów University of Technology** with 6 semesters completed.  
📊 I'm passionate about **database systems and SQL**, **neural networks** and **mathematical modeling** for solving practical problems such as optimization and econometric analysis. I also have strong knowledge in **discrete mathematics** and **probability theory**, which support and strengthen my analytical thinking. 
💡 I mainly work with **Python**, **R** and **SQL** to explore data, find patterns and better understand real-world problems through analysis.
🏓 Before university, I was a competitive **table tennis player**, participating in multiple **Polish Championships**. One day, I plan to combine this passion with **machine learning**, creating something that bridges the gap between what I love and what I study.

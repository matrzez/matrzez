## Welcome to my GitHub profile 👨‍💻

### 👋 About Me

🎓 I'm a third-year **Engineering and Data Analysis** student at **Rzeszów University of Technology**, currently completing my 6th semester.  
📊 I'm passionate about **databases and their administration**, **R programming**, **discrete mathematics**, and **probability theory**.  
💡 I mostly work with **SQL**, **R**, and **Python**, applying them in data analysis.  
🏓 Before university, I was a competitive **table tennis player**, participating in multiple **Polish Championships**. One day, I plan to combine this passion with **machine learning**, creating something that bridges the gap between what I love and what I study.  


### 💻 Languages & Tools I Use

#### 🎮 C#
- Getting familiar with syntax and core OOP concepts.  
#### 📄 LaTeX
- **Presentation with Beamer** – creating academic and professional presentations using the `beamer` package.  
- **Academic Documentation** – writing professional documents in an academic tone, utilizing LaTeX's advanced formatting tools and templates.  
- Currently integrating LaTeX rendering into Django-based app.  
#### 🐍 Python
- **Data Science Libraries** – using libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` for data manipulation, numerical operations, and visualization.   
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** – working with `scikit-learn` for classical ML models, and `tensorflow`, `keras` for building and training neural networks.   
- **Practical Applications** – applying Python in academic and personal projects involving data analysis, optimization, and statistical modeling.  
#### 📊 R
- **Statistical Computing** – used for statistical analysis, data exploration, and visualization using libraries like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`.    
- **Coursework Applications** – used extensively during university courses such as Time Series, Statistical Data Analysis, Nonlinear Optimization, Stochastic Process Modeling and Programming in R.   

#### 🐘 SQL
- **Practical SQL Querying** – able to effectively query existing databases using SQL, performing operations such as filtering, joining, and aggregating data.  
- **Database Design & Structure** – creating and designing basic database objects and structures such as tables, views, indexes, and relationships.    
- **Optimization** – experience with query optimization to improve performance, including indexing and analyzing execution plans.   
- **Database Administration** – skills in database system administration, including user management, backup creation, and performance monitoring.  


### 📚 Currently Learning

- 🐳 **Docker + Django** – Building a web application inspired by Overleaf to integrate analytics and visualization tools.  
- 📊 **Bayesian Networks** – Merging R and probability theory for analysis and visualization of Bayesian networks.  
- 🧠 **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – Learning their use in image processing and spatial data.
- 📝 **Bachelor’s Thesis In Progress** – *"Optimization Algorithms in Neural Network Training"*.  


### 🌱 Open To

## Welcome to my GitHub profile 👨‍💻

### 👋 About Me

🎓 I'm a third-year **Engineering and Data Analysis** student at **Rzeszów University of Technology**, currently completing my 6th semester.  
📊 I'm passionate about **databases and their administration**, **R programming**, **discrete mathematics**, and **probability theory**.  
💡 I mostly work with **SQL**, **R**, and **Python**, applying them in data analysis.  
🏓 Before university, I was a competitive **table tennis player**, participating in multiple **Polish Championships**. One day, I plan to combine this passion with **machine learning**, creating something that bridges the gap between what I love and what I study.
